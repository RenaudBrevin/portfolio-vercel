First I deployed my site thanks to Vercel. But I had a lot of problems because nobody warned me that it would not work in PHP. Besides I still do not know how I will do to put online my complete site that contains PHP.

I then added Checkly to get more information about my site such as loading speed.

I also added two extensions. ImgBot that handles images on my website and CodeFactor to find errerues in my code.

Finally, thanks to zappier, I have linked a discord bot to my github which aims to send a message with the discord commit every time I push on github.
